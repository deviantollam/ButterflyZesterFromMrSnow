The Butterly Pocket MicroPlane - "Fly Pocket Zest"

3D print the parts per the orientation, strength, and material that makes sense for you. This isn't a mission critical part...

Cut the micro plane to about 75mm in OAL. Use the 3D printed center support piece to drill holes, flush with the bottom edge of plane. Assemble with chicago screws. 

Enjoy your new power of zesting on the go!
